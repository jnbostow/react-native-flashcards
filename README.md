iOS apps can only be developed on a Mac unless you have a virtual machine set up on your machine. To set up the iPhone simulator on your Mac, follow these instructions:

1. Go to the App Store.
2. Download Xcode.
3. Follow the installation instructions.
4. Open Xcode and install additional software if prompted to do so.
If you already have Xcode installed, please make sure that you update it. Then, open it to make sure no further updates are needed. Most problems with setting up your React Native development environment can be solved this way.
